# ARMA Election Forecasting

This is my project for the "Machine Learning in Python" class with Professor Marek Radzikowski at SGH Warsaw School of Economics. It was developed using Python and data from [ewybory.eu](https://ewybory.eu).

And yes, I am aware that ARMA is not a machine learning algorithm, but we are graded on accuracy, not the method.
